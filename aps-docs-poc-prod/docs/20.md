# Processing payments

Swiftly give your customers a user-friendly, secure payment experience
thanks to easy-to-implement payment integration routes from Amazon
Payment Services.

We support all popular global card networks and many local payment
options too. Your customers can also pay using [digital
wallets](24b.md) including Masterpass, Visa and Apple Pay.

In this section we cover standard payment processing integration for
ordinary, one-off e-commerce transactions. In other words, where a
customer visits your site, fills a shopping cart with items, checks out,
and pays.

Refer to the next section for [more advanced payment processing
requirements](30.md) including recurring payments, batch
processing and invoicing.

Website integration
-------------------

Amazon Payment Services offers you four routes to start accepting
payments on your website. You can choose rapid implementation, or
harness your development resources to offer a highly customized payment
experience:

1.  [**Standard merchant page integration**](22a.md). A rapid
    yet customizable route to giving your customers a seamless checkout
    experience right on your website.

2.  [**Custom merchant page integration**](22b.md). Meet your
    challenging technical and customization requirements with a
    custom-coded payment form, hosted on your website.

3.  [**Redirection to payment gateway**](22c.md). The simplest
    integration method, redirecting your customer to our web server for
    payment processing.

4.  [**Plugins for popular e-commerce suites**](22d.md). Already
    using Magento, PrestaShop, Shopify or WooCommerce? You can plug
    Amazon Payment Services straight into your e-commerce suite.

integration options here](22.md).

Mobile integration
------------------

Offer your customers a slick mobile shopping experience so that they can
shop when and where they want.

For the best mobile shopping experience we recommend that you code an
in-app payment processing experience that [directly connects to our
API](22b.md). If you have more limited development resources you
can use our [Android and iOS SDKs](23b.md) to more rapidly
incorporate in-app payments -- without redirecting your customers to a
mobile browser for payment.

If your business does not have a dedicated, native app you can still
accommodate mobile customers by offering [mobile-friendly
checkout](23a.md) right on your website. Our customizable
website integration route allows you to fine-tune your website payment
form to match responsive design objectives, offering a great experience
no matter the screen size of your customer's device.
