Protect Plus
=================

For maximum anti-fraud capabilities, you should consider activating our
advanced fraud protection service, called **Protect Plus.**

Protect Plus uses intelligent, real-time analysis that uses machine
learning models to detect fraudulent activity.

What is Protect Plus?
---------------------

Protect Plus adds a powerful additional layer of fraud prevention and it
can be used in combination with our standard fraud management service,
Protect. Protect Plus means that you further safeguard online payment
processing in your merchant account. By doing so you also minimize
chargebacks.

When should I use advanced fraud protection?
--------------------------------------------

Under most payment processing scenarios, we would recommend that
merchants consider enrolling in **Protect Plus** to enable advanced
fraud protection on their merchant accounts.

Protect Plus provides significantly more capable anti-fraud measures
compared to Protect, our standard, rules-based anti-fraud solution.

However, if you have an existing anti-fraud solution, you might choose
to use Protect instead. Protect exercises minimal influence on your
transaction workflow.

How do I activate Protect Plus?
-------------------------------

Amazon Payment Services will activate our advanced fraud protection for
you on request. You will then need to custom code interactions with
**Protect Plus** to ensure that you obtain maximum advantage out of
Protect Plus functionality.

ðŸ‘† Protect Plus can be used with both authorization and purchase
operations.
