## Option 2: Uploading your own CSS or HTML template:

 If you want to have more control on the payment page design and add more edits , you have two options.

### 1: CSS Theme :
Create a CSS theme by modifying the colors and overall design of the payment page. Inspect the elements of the payment page and edit the existing CSS values accordingly. Save your changes to a separate CSS file and **upload it to our back-office**.

:::tip tip
