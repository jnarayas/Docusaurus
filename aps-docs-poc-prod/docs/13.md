Throughout this section, and in our API reference and SDK guides, you
will see reference to *PayFort.* You may also see reference to *Fort* or
*FORT*.

We continue to use *PayFort* and *Fort* in our documentation for the
simple reason that the code that powers Amazon Payment Services still
contains references to PayFort.

To ensure ongoing stability, and to minimize the development overhead
for our customers, we are slowly but steadily changing references to
*PayFort* across our core code and our documentation.

In the meantime, when you see *PayFort* or *Fort*, you can safely assume
that we are referring to Amazon Payment Services features and benefits.
