Getting started with testing
============================

You can freely test, and experiment with, most of the features Amazon
Payment Services offers. You can do so without ever transferring any
funds, and without the need to use a live payment card number that is
linked to the banking network.

We facilitate testing by offering you a choice of TEST and LIVE
endpoints. The TEST endpoint is a sandbox environment that does not
interact with the real banking system. To test transactions in the
sandbox environment you make use of a test credit card number.

Signing up for a test account
-----------------------------

Do you want to try out Amazon Payment Services to see how it fits in
with your web or mobile application? Get in touch with us here for an
initial consultation so that we can set up a test account for you.

Once set up you can use your test account to explore our integration and
API features in a test environment by connecting to the test endpoint.
It gives you the opportunity to see the exact same responses that your
customers will see once you go live, but without transferring funds
during the transaction -- and without the need to use a live payment
card.

When you use the test endpoint you can freely test functionality,
without ever triggering transactions that impact your merchant account,
or your customers. By using the test account you can ensure a smooth
experience for your customers once you go live.

Test endpoints
--------------

When you communicate with Amazon Payment Services via an API each
touchpoint used during the communication process is called an endpoint.
Your merchant site will communicate with resources at Amazon Payment
Services using a specific endpoint.

Each endpoint consists out of a URL that points to a service run on an
Amazon Payment Services web server. In your code you have the choice of
referring to a live endpoint, or to a test endpoint. For the purpose of
testing we offer a sandbox endpoint. The sandbox (or test endpoint) is
denoted by an "sb" in the URL.

For example, the endpoints for our standard merchant page integration
route are:

**Live**

https://checkout.payfort.com/FortAPI/paymentPage

**Sandbox**

https://sbcheckout.payfort.com/FortAPI/paymentPage

Any requests sent to sbcheckout.payfort.com will be handled as a test
request and will not impact your live account or result in any charges
or movement of funds.

Test payment card numbers
------------------------

Use the list of card numbers below to test your integration across our supported payment methods. Testing your merchant integration with the card numbers listed below will never result in a financial transaction or a transfer of funds.

!!! example  "Note"
    Note that the numbers listed below will only work if your integration is set to use the test endpoints
