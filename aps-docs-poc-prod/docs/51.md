Security settings
=================

You can control several security aspects of your Amazon Payment Services
account via the security settings page in the back office.

On this page you can generate and refresh the access code for your
Amazon Payment Services accounts, set your SHA request and response
phrases, and boost security by restricting requests to specific IP
ranges or URLs.

Generating an access code
-------------------------

When connecting to the Amazon Payment Services API you must specify an
access code in the request that you send. Each of your Amazon Payment
Services accounts has a unique access code.

You can retrieve your access code on the security settings page, where
you can also generate a new access code for your account if you need to
do so.

Selecting the SHA type
----------------------

Amazon Payment Services allows you to choose a hashing algorithm that
meets your requirements. Currently, you can choose from SHA-256 and
SHA-512, as well as HMAC-256 and HMAC-512.

You can switch your choice on the security settings page. You can also
adjust your SHA passphrase for requests and responses on the security
settings page.

Whitelisting by origin
----------------------

You can boost security by restricting interactions with your Amazon
Payment Services account to whitelisted servers, or whitelisted URLs.

First, by specifying a list of whitelisted IP addresses you can ensure
that Amazon Payment Services will only respond to requests sent from the
IP addresses in the Origin IP range.

Likewise, you can specify a list of URLs which ensure that Amazon
Payment Services only responds to a request from a whitelisted URL --
the origin URL.

If you do not specify an origin IP address or an origin URL, Amazon
Payment Services will examine requests coming from any IP address or URL
-- subject to verifying the credentials submitted in the request.
